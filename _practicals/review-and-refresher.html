abstract: "<p>In this review and refresher notebook we mix some review work with some of the concepts we’d like you to develop and understand as you progress through the course. The review work focuses on the use of probability, correlation, pandas and the jupyter notebook. Most of the code you need is provided in the notebook, there are a few exercises to help develop your understanding.</p>"

<p>Welcome to the review and refresh practical. This work is for you to remind yourself about the ways of using the notebook. You will have a chance to ask us questions about the content on 9th of November. Within the material you will find exercises. If you are confident with probability you can likely ignore the reading and exercises which are listed from <span class="citation" data-cites="Rogers:book11">Rogers and Girolami (2011)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Bishop:book06">Bishop (2006)</span>. There should be <em>no need</em> to purchase these books for this course. The suggestions of sections are there just as a reminder.</p>
<p>We suggest you run these labs in <em>Google colab</em>, there’s a link to doing that on the main lab page at the top. We also suggest that the first thing you do is click <code>View</code>-&gt;<code>Expand sections</code> to make all parts of the lab visibile.</p>
<p>We suggest you complete at least Exercises 4-9.</p>
