We expect that knowledge of the local region around the property should be helpful in making those price predictions. To evaluate this we will now look at [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as a data source.\n",

Using what you have learned about the `osmx` interface in the lectures, write general code for downloading points of interest and other relevant information that you believe may be useful for predicting house prices. Remembering the perspectives we've taken on *data science as debugging*, the remarks we've made when discussing *the data crisis* of the importance of reusability in data analysis, and the techniques we've explored in the labsessions for visualising features and exploring their correlation use the notebook to document your assessment of the OpenStreetMap data as a potential source of data.\n",
